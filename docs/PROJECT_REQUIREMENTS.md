# Project Requirements: DW6 Protocol Refinement

This project aims to harden the DW6 protocol by addressing critical flaws identified during initial setup and testing. The goal is to create a robust, fully automated, and user-friendly development workflow.

## 1. Requirement: Robust Environment and Dependency Management

-   **Problem:** The initial project setup fails to reliably create a Python virtual environment (`venv`) and install the necessary dependencies from `pyproject.toml`. This is a critical failure that makes the project unusable from the start.
-   **Goal:** The DW6 setup process must be 100% reliable.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   A `venv` directory must be successfully created in the project root.
    -   All project and test dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` must be successfully installed into the `venv`.
    -   The setup script must provide clear, explicit feedback, confirming the successful creation of the environment and installation of dependencies.
    -   The script must halt with a clear error message if any part of this process fails.

## 2. Requirement: Seamless, Programmatic GitHub Integration

-   **Problem:** The workflow repeatedly triggers UI-based prompts for GitHub authentication, breaking the command-line experience and preventing automation. The system also fails to detect existing Git repository information.
-   **Goal:** All Git and GitHub operations must be handled programmatically without manual UI intervention.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The DW6 engine must automatically detect the remote repository URL from the local `.git/config` file.
    -   The system must use a `GITHUB_TOKEN` from a `.env` file for all `git push` and other GitHub API operations.
    -   The setup workflow must guide the user in creating a `.env` file with the required `GITHUB_TOKEN` if one does not exist.
    -   No UI-based authentication prompts should appear during any part of the workflow.

## 3. Requirement: Research and Propose Solutions

-   **Problem:** The underlying causes of the setup failures and authentication issues need to be investigated.
-   **Goal:** Conduct research to identify the best technical solutions for the problems identified.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   Investigate best practices for scripting virtual environment creation and activation in Bash/Python.
    -   Research methods for robustly handling dependency installation with `pip` and `pyproject.toml`.
    -   Identify the best libraries (e.g., `python-dotenv`, `gitpython`) for managing environment variables and programmatic Git operations.
    -   Produce a research summary outlining the recommended tools and implementation strategies.
